    The main thing that jumps out to me when looking at the difference between questions that get a lot of answers and questions that don't get much or any feedback is specificity. Generally speaking, it is likely that someone else has either come across the same or a very similar problem to the one that you're asking a question about, so the more specific you are, the better others will be able to help you, and the more willing they will be to do so. I think that from the perspective of someone writing an answer, it is gratifying to see exactly where the person got stuck and be able to relate this to an experience they had themselves, especially if the answerer was recently in the same situation. It is very gratifying when you can be confident that your answer will be meaningful to someone who has made an effort to get to where they currently are but are stuck behind a roadblock that you just recently figured out how to climb over.

    In order to be specific, it is crucial to orient the reader as to where you are in a certain process. While too much background and too broad a context is off-putting/daunting, just the right amount of context can be the key to getting lots of good responses. The more you can isolate the problem yourself before asking a question, the better. The point is that you want the reader to be able to visualize your situation, see the roadblock within it, and easily ask themselves, "what would I do in this person's situation, knowing what I know?"

    One other specific thing to do might be to say what things you have already tried in your attempts to solve a problem. This shows others that a) you have put in the effort to make your own attempts, and b) it reduces your chances of getting back mostly obvious answers that won't be helpful because you have already tried implementing them unsuccessfully. One of the most common things one can observe on Q and A forums is an initial back-and-forth between questioner and answerer regarding what the questioner has or hasn't already tried.
