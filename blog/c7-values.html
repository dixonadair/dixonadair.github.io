    When I think of the times in my life where Iâ€™ve been the happiest, proudest, and most satisfied, some of the following values come to mind: autonomy, competence, control, efficiency, excellence, creativity, knowledge, self-knowledge, truth, and will-power.
  </p>
  <p class="post">
    Extent to which I feel I live up to the values that I consider important:
    autonomy: 4, 
    competenece: 4, 
    control: 3, 
    efficiency: 4, 
    excellence: 3.5, 
    creativity: 5, 
    knowledge: 4.5, 
    self-knowledge: 5, 
    truth: 5, 
    will-power: 2.5
  </p>

    To me, one of the most important values in life is truth. I am someone who finds cognitive dissonance completely unbearable, and so I am intellectually motivated to want to resolve any dissonance if it arises. I don't like "fuzzy" or unclear thinking, and so I try to make sure I am not allowing myself to believe a convenient explanation when there is a truthful, albeit sometimes less convenient or comforting explanation for something.

    I definitely think that thinking about my values can help me combat stereotype threat if and when it might arise. Thinking about the things I value most would help me to focus my attention away from the ultimately insignificant fear of stereotype threat, and towards what I think is truly important in life.
