    While there will always be technical challenges that arise with new technologies, especially cutting edge-technologies that test the boundaries of what has been possible up to the present, many of these challenges will be gradually worked out over time as the technology matures and becomes fine-tuned. One of the greatest and most persistent long-term challenges, however, is and will continue to be that of technology-related security.

    The key characteristic of security, including anything from protecting against the theft of commercially valuable information to safeguarding personal privacy, is that it is a moving target. While problems like creating better and longer-lasting batteries, for example, are no doubt daunting and are extremely important technological problems, these challenges are ultimately battles against physics and our understanding of how to manipulate its laws to our advantage. While physics operates according to consistent rules, humans, namely those who attempt to steal, corrupt or otherwise do harm by means of technology, are constantly becoming more skilled, updating their methods when previous methods have been figured out and stopped. According to some sources, up to 97% of websites are vulnerable to hacking.

    As more and more human interaction, economic transactions, and business activity goes online, security and the protection of privacy will only continue to be an increasingly important challenge, and one that will never go away.
