<h2 style="align:center">Difference between Margin, Border, Padding, and Content</h2>

<p>At first, it may seem strange to someone who is using HTML and CSS for the first time that there are fully three different things that can go around any given content. Why not just have borders? Perhaps the most intuitive way to think about the difference between margin, border and padding is to think about a picture frame.</p>

<img style="align:center; left:0; right:0" alt="mbpc_picture" src="mbpc_pic.jpg" style="height:300px; width=600px">

<p>Let's start by thinking about the margin. If you go into an art gallery, works of art are almost never so close to each other that their frames touch. One can think of this distance (or "breathing room") as the margin.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is the wooden picture frame itself, which has its own thickness and color. This is the border.</p>

<p>Third comes the padding. The most common real world example of padding can be seen in picture frames for family photos. It is the 1-3 inch (usually beige) strip that puts a little distance between the picture frame and the picture. This can be thought of as the padding. Whereas the margin is the breathing room between the border of one element and another element, the padding is the breathing room between the element (content) and its own border.</p>
