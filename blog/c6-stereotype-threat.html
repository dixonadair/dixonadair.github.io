    Stereotype threat is the idea that the stereotypes typically associated with a certain characteristic of a person will end up becoming self-fulfilling prophecies, in that the person with the characteristic will think of themselves in the way they are usually stereotyped and act accordingly, whether they mean to, or even whether they do so consciously, or not.

    While I have been lucky in life not to have encountered many situations in which I have felt the negative effects of stereotype threat, I very much empathize with others who live with this phenomenon on a day-to-day basis, and realize the incredible amount of lost potential that can be a result of stereotype threat. I have always felt that if people are ever to be categorized, the only legitimate category to use is people's true personality and the way their minds work, not anything to do with factors outside of their control, like race, gender, nationality, and so forth. Especially when travelling, I have encountered situations where I meet someone who I find very intellectually similar yet, who I come to empathize with because I quickly realize that the context they live in does not allow them to flourish in the same way that I have done in comparable areas of my life.

    The way that I can most relate to stereotype threat on a personal level is in classroom  situations. Groups of students tend to develop a certain group personality which is unique to that particular combination of students, and each student often gets stereotyped within the context of that student group. One can be easily become affected, in terms of the way one subconsciously acts, by the way they think other students already perceive them. A student who has started the school term poorly may subconsciously think there is little point to making more of an effort because they are already assumed to be a failure, and vice versa. Furthermore, students who are assumed to be the "smartest" in the class are not helped by stereotype threat either because they may refrain from asking important question out of a fear of appearing stupid to others.

  	To combat stereotype threat, it is important to remember that we should be the only one's who can define ourselves. We should never let others' preconceived notions of the way we are or the way we "probably will act," given any number of characteristics, determine the way we conduct ourselves.
