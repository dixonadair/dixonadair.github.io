    While there are indeed many differences between JavaScript and Ruby, a lot of those differences are largely syntactic, and not fundamental in terms of the way that we think about structuring logic in the two languages.

    For instance, one difference is the way hashes are written in Ruby vs. the way that their equivalent (objects) are written in JavaScript. In Ruby, the most conventional way to write a hash (if you were writing the hash all at once from the beginning), is as follows:
  </p>

  <pre>
  <code>
    Capitals = { "Georgia" => "Atlanta",
        "Alabama" => "Montgomery",
        "Mississippi" => "Jackson" }
  </code>
  </pre>

  <p class="post">
    You could also create a new empty hash and then fill its contents as you went along, as follows:
  </p>

  <pre>
  <code>
    Capitals = Hash.new
    Capitals["Georgia"] = "Atlanta"
    Capitals["Alabama"] = "Montgomery"
    Capitals["Mississippi"] = "Jackson"
  </code>
  </pre>

  <p class="post">
    In Javascript, the same hash above would be written as an object as follows:
  </p>

  <pre>
  <code>
    var Capitals = {
      "Georgia": "Atlanta",
      "Alabama": "Montgomery",
      "Mississippi": "Jackson"
    }
  </code>
  </pre>

    You can also create objects within objects, like so:
  </p>

  <pre>
  <code>
    jim.children = {
      carson: {name: "Carson"},
      carter: {name: "Carter"},
      colton: {name: "Colton"}
    }
  </code>
  </pre>

</main>
