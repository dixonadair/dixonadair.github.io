			Here we specify that for each element (number) in the category (array)that it belongs to, double it.

		<img alt="JS_i_in_num" src="JS for i in num.png" align="center">
		<div>
			Or we can use a more explicit way, by specifying a series of values to be used as indexes and go through each one in the block specified under the for statement. In slight contrast to Ruby, all the conditions regarding how the for loop should work ("iterate through") are specified on the "for statement" line: i's starting value, i's ending value (implied in that it must stay below a certain value), as well as the increment for each new iteration.

<!-- 		<div>
			Below are ways of setting up loops in Ruby.

		<img alt="Ruby_map" src="Ruby map function.png" align="center">
		<div>
			Ruby has a convenient map function which allows us to imply that whatever block of code comes next will apply to each element within an array that the map function is called on. This is simpler than in JS, where we explicitly state that for each a in b, do the following to each a. Here we don't need to explicitly write out that we want the block to apply for each element in the array, as this is implied within the map function.

			A more explicit way of course is to specify a series of values to be used as indexes and go through each one in the block specified under the for statement.
