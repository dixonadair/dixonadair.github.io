    I have increasingly enjoyed the pairing process as DBC has progressed. Being a somewhat introverted person, and one who generally likes solving problems alone, I was initially quite hesitant about the idea of peer-pairing. I tend to be more comfortable thinking about problems by myself before engaging with others in trying to solve them, and my biggest fear before I got used to pairing was not being able to think through a challenge with someone else at an even or synchronized pace, and thus having moments where I needed to stop and think about something (thus creating an awkward silence while the other person waited, or did something else) before continuing.

    What I have realized now is that pairing can actually be more efficient, motivating, and rewarding than solving problems alone. The efficiency comes from the fact that people's skillsets will almost always be shaped somewhat like Venn diagrams; what one person knows, the other may not, and vice versa. What struck me more, though, was that far from being more nerve-racking and imposter-syndrome-inducing than doing things alone, pairing is actually a great way to reassure oneself of one's sanity. It is comforting to realize that different people generally find the same concepts more difficult than other concepts, and the same problems more time-consuming than other problems. It is rarely the case that a challenge one considered to be the hardest of the week was considered by someone else to be the easiest.

    The feedback that I have received so far has definitely been helpful to my learning. As far as improving based on others' feedback, the consistent theme seems to be sticking more closely to driver-navigator roles. Because I tend to be a take-charge person, I often jump right in and at times end up both driving and navigating, even if only for a short while. I think the best way to improve is to check in with the other person more often to make sure everyone is on the same page, and to resist the temptation to write down the code I have in mind as I navigate aloud, when working with others.

    Specific and actionable feedback can often be rather difficult to write. Typically, when there is good communication between the two people pairing, much of the feedback has already been given during the pairing session and was of a specific nature. Any problems that occurred during the  session were addressed as they arose. If there is poor communication, or misunderstanding, this tends to be the main area that can be addressed in the general feedback given after the pairing has occurred, along with a later realization that not enough time-boxing was used.
