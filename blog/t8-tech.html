    While Ted Stevens quote may be amusing, it does ironically provide a good starting point for understanding the internet as a system and not a "thing". Just as "the grid" connects inidividual homes and businesses to a power source, so does the internet connect computers and servers to each other. Put simply, the internet is a series of interconnected fiber optic cables and wires that allow computers around the world to communicate.

    Servers are computers that are directly connected to the internet, and thus can communicate directly with each other. It is important to understand that most computers, however, namely the computers the average person uses every day, are called clients, and are not directly connected to the internet, but rather, are indirectly connected through internet service providers (ISPs). If you use AOL, for instance, you would be connected to the internet through AOL as your internet service provider, and all of your internet activity would be routed through that ISP.

    So, how is it that all of the information being circulated through the internet is able to find its way to the correct destination? This is where IP addresses and routers come in. All devices that are connected to the internet, whether they be computers, cell phones, servers, ISPs, or the devices that take in and direct information to and from these other devices (known as routers), have IP addresses. It may be useful to think of routers as traffic cops that direct travelers (flowing information) at the intersections of the internet in a world where drivers have destinations (and mapquest instructions in hand) but aren't smart enough to read them. Each time the traveler gets to a new intersection, the traffic cop looks at their mapquest printout, peels off the part of the instructions relating to the already arrived-at intersection, and sends the traveler down the next correct street to the next intersection. This process is repeated until the traveler arrives at their destination.
