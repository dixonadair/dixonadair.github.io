    One conflict that I experienced a few years ago when traveling abroad involved a connecting flight that I missed and ended up having to pay for again due to a nearly 5 hour delay on the first leg of the trip. In retrosepct, it taught me a lot about how I naturally approach conflict, and how to deal with it better in future. The first flight was domestic, and the connecting flight was international (on seperate airlines), with a 4 and a half hour layover in the connecting airport. When I heard the first announcement that the domestic flight would be delayed by an hour, I wasn't concerned at all. In fact, I felt grateful that I didn't have a close connection to make, in contrast to certain other passengers who surely found themselves in a more nerve-racking situation. After another 45 minutes went by, the announcer said the flight would be delayed by yet another hour. I was a bit more concerned this time, but still thought that I had plenty of time on the other end. The third time this announcement was made, however, I began to get angry. Shortly after this, another announcement was made that all passengers would be transported to the city's other airport to depart from there. Still I kept my composure, now figuring that the problem, whatever it was, was being actively resolved, despite being very unhappy (although not as visibly unhappy as most of the other passengers).

    Shortly after arriving at the other airport, though, yet another announcement was made that the plane still hadn't come in yet, and that it was difficult to estimate when it would arrive. I overheard others angrily talking about how this was a common problem with this airline; that even when they were aware of a potential 3 hour delay, they would make incremental announcements every hour so as not make people overly angry from the start. At this point, I lost my cool, and went straight to the airline's front desk to demand that they find another flight or flights leaving as soon as possible that would get me to my destination. I was quite sure that if I waited for the current flight, I would miss my connecting flight. In retrosepct, I think that because I approached the person at the desk in an overly aggressive and accusatory fashion to begin with, this made them less willing to help me, and meant that the alternatives they offered were not attractive enough for it to be worth me taking them, especially since I thought there was still a chance I would make the connecting flight. I ended up waiting for and taking the original flight and missing the connecting flight.

    If I could go back, I would have done several things differently. First, I would have brought my concerns to the front desk earlier, possibly after the second or at most, third announcement. Admittedly, I didn't know that the airline was notorious for "incremental delay announcements," but as a general rule, this way of dealing with a situation works better. I wouldn't have been as worked up or nervous at that point and might have arrived at a better deal earlier. It is easier to put off conflict until the very end because it is so unpleasant, but one can make conflicts less unpleasant by dealing with them sooner when tensions have not built up as much. Second, I would have approached the person at the front desk in a calmer fashion which may well have resulted in a better deal for me. The main emotion that I felt was indignation, and fear that my money was going to be wasted due to someone else's negligence. I felt that it was wrong of them not to notify me of the full extent of a problem when such information could have been useful to me in making a better decision earlier.
