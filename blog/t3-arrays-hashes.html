    Both arrays and hashes in Ruby are what are known as "indexed collections." This means that you can store a list of items in them and use indexes to pinpoint any given one of those items when you need it. In other words, you can think about arrays and hashes like lists of things you can store and access later at any time. Arrays and hashes differ, however, in the way their elements are accessed, but both consist of "key-value" pairs.

    Think of an array as a list of names on a roster. If there are twenty students in a class, the array will contain twenty elements, ordered 0 through 19. Note that each student name would be assigned a numerical index, so the 5th student could be accessed like so: roster[4]. Therefore, with arrays, the key is a number (quantitative). If you didn't remember which number a student was in the list, you might have wished you'd used a hash with personality descriptors as keys instead. In short, arrays are more efficient, but the tradeoff is flexibility.

    Hashes, on the other hand, are indexed with a word or other descriptor, and thus have qualitative keys. For instance, you could have a hash of all the countries of the world with their corresponding capitals. You could access the capital of Canada like so: capitals['Canada'] and return 'Ottawa'. That way, you wouldn't have to remember the numerical index of 'Ottawa', unlike if it had been stored with other capitals in an array. This allows for more flexibility, while the tradeoff is efficiency.
