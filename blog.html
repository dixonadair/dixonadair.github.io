<h4>Fireside Chat Reflection</h4>

<h4>Date: Nov 21, 2014</h4>

<p>My conception of Dev Bootcamp is that it is a learning environment where personal engagement is paramount, and I think the “restaurant vs. kitchen mentality” sums up the DBC experience and philosophy very well. Much of traditional education is based on the mentality of being served, rather than the mentality of being engaged, and I agree that this largely stems from our culture of consumerism. It can sometimes be difficult to get out of the consumer mindset because we tend to adopt that mentality in many other areas of our lives, so I am a bit nervous, but I think it will ultimately be a refreshing and rewarding experience. Being in an environment where others have adopted a kitchen mindset also makes it much easier to do the same.</p>

<p>One thing that clicked with me while watching the video was the appropriateness of putting the more “rote memorization” or “muscle memory” learning portion of the course in Phase 0, as this allows Phases 1-3, when all the students are working together face-to-face, to be even more engaging, and I can see how this fits into the DBC philosophy. Admittedly, there are certain things you simply have to sit down and memorize, but by getting that out of the way in Phase 0, I can imagine how this would create an even more collaborative environment in future phases. From talking to several Chinese friends, I have heard that some children in China are often told to memorize their multiplication tables before they really even have the ability to understand what they are doing, so that when they do begin to learn multiplication, the building blocks are already there. This way, they come to not only understand the concepts, but implement them with speed.</p>

<p>Lastly, the idea of being disciplined when it comes to extricating oneself from the depths of a specific problem (aka “a rabbit hole”) really resonated with me. I often find myself in this situation and sometimes don’t know how best to deal with it. Should I step back because I have been barking up the wrong tree for 3 hours or have I actually almost arrived at the solution? This can be a challenging call to make, and I hope to get better at it as I go through DBC.</p>

<h4>Gitting with the program</h4>

<h4>Date: Nov 21, 2014</h4>

<p>One of the main reasons version control is so beneficial when working on coding projects is that they can quickly get very intricate and complicated, and version control helps you manage this complexity. Let’s say you’ve been working on a project which, up to the present moment, is functioning properly. You then go on to add another feature but realize this messes up the rest of your code. Instead of having to go back into your code and figure out which lines need to be surgically removed, you could have simply committed your changes at the time the code was running smoothly, and after problems arise, go back to the previous version to start with a clean slate. If you are worried in advance that the next feature you need to work on may prove troublesome, you can also use branching, which allows you to experiment with changes before deciding to include them in the master file. This allows you to experiment with an alternate reality that is built upon your existing (working) code, before deciding to commit to it.</p>

<p>Git helps you keep track of changes through commits. Each “commit” is basically the saving of a new version of your code/project. For Mac users who use Time Machine: you can think of a commit like a backup, because a commit is simply the saving of a snapshot of your code at a given point in time.</p>

<p>There are many reasons to store your code on Github. One of the main benefits of storing code on Github can be seen when working on group projects, or when you want to make your code for a certain program or piece of software you’ve created open source. When working on a team, each developer (no matter where they are on earth, as long as they have an internet connection), can pull and push changes to and from their local copy of the github repository to the online master repository, and thereby fetch the contributions of others to the same code while adding their own contributions. With open source software, having the source code on Github allows others to submit suggested improvements to your software, as well as personalize the software for their own particular needs.</p>
