    According to both online tests and self-assessment, I think I am predominantly an abstract sequential thinker. I imagine that some of the advantages of this thinking style when applied to DBC work material will be that I approach problems logically and analytically, and try to think about the most efficient and effective solution. I also tend to think about multiple possible solutions to a problem before proceeding to attempt to implement the one I have determined will be the best solution. The main drawbacks of my thinking style when applied to DBC work will probably be most notable during the on-site phases of the program. I tend to quite perfectionistic in terms of wanting to understand something fully before I move to the implementation phase, and this may not always be possible given the time pressures at DBC. This will be frustrating for me and may challenge me to accept not fully understanding something while implementing it.

    In terms of growth and fixed mindset, I think I tend to be quite open to adopting new ideas and progressing intellectually even if this means accepting new ideas into my way of thinking that conflict with old ideas. Habits, on the other hand, are usually harder to change as they are more engrained. Lifestyle habits are more difficult to change because I like following procedures that have consistently worked well for me and am less keen on lifestyle experimentation than idea experimentation.

    Finally, another challenge I may find is when it comes to repeating tasks over and over again. I most enjoy going from one idea to the next and from one problem to the next, so getting stuck on a particular problem for technical reasons even when I am sure that I have understood the problem at a conceptual level can be extremely frustrating. It isn’t that I don’t enjoy minutiae or am not a detail-oriented thinker, but rather, that I get frustrated when a certain technical detail gets in the way of solving a broader or more interesting problem.
